Task for Junior Quantitative Analyst in Credit Risk Model Validation

**Objective:**
Analyze the Portuguese Bank Marketing dataset (Moro et al., 2011) 
and build a predictive model for client subscription to a term deposit (“y”) based on demographic and campaign features.

The workflow follows a structured approach combining exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature preprocessing, modeling, and evaluation.

**Conclusion:**
The model reasonably distinguishes deposit subscribers but struggles with precision due to class imbalance.
