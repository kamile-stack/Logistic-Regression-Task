Task for Junior Quantitative Analyst in Credit Risk Model Validation

Objective:
Analyze the Portuguese Bank Marketing dataset (Moro et al., 2011) and build a predictive model for client subscription to a term deposit (“y”) based on demographic and campaign features.

The workflow followed a structured approach combining exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature preprocessing, modeling, and evaluation.

Conclusion:
The model reasonably distinguished deposit subscribers but struggled with precision due to class imbalance.
